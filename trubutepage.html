            <p class="line">A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, (born October 15, 1931,
                Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong), Indian scientist and politician who played a leading
                role in the development of India’s missile and nuclear weapons programs. He was president of India from
                2002 to 2007.<br>

            <h1 class="title" class="line">Educational Background of Kalam</h1>
            <p class="line">Although Kalam had average grades in school, he was very hard working and had an immense
                desire to learn. He spent a lot of time studying and had developed a particular interest in mathematics.
                Kalam left Schwartz higher secondary school after completing his early education and went to Saint
                Joseph's College, Tiruchirapalli. From Saint Joseph's College, he graduated in physics in 1954. He moved
                to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering at Madras Institute of Technology.</p>

            <p class="line">Kalam joined as a scientist in the aeronautical development establishment of DRDO in 1960,
                after graduation. His career started with him designing a small hovercraft. However, he was not
                convinced by his choice of a job at the DRDO. Kalam was transferred to ISRO in 1969, where he was the
                project director of India's first satellite vehicle launch. The satellite vehicle deployed the Rohini
                satellite successfully in near-Earth orbit in July 1980. Kalam received the Government's LV and Slv
                projects between the 1970s-90s. He directed two projects like Project Devil and Project Valiant, which
                aimed at developing ballistic missiles from the successful SLV program's technology Kalam somehow
                convinced Indira Gandhi and sought secret funds for these aerospace projects. His research and immense
                knowledge brought him and the nation great laurels in the 1980s.

            <p class="line">Sir Kalam was entitled to be the 11th president of India. His term period of 25th July 2002
                to 25th July 2007 was achieved by winning a presidential election in 2002 with a massive margin of
                votes. National Democratic Alliances nominated him to be president and it was supported by Samajwadi
                Party and National Congress Party. He was lovingly called as peoples president as he had done
                uncountable works for the welfare of the people and through the entire country.<br>He was brave and
                courageous enough to take decisions and implement them no matter if that was tough or sensitive or
                highly controversial. The “office of profit” is perhaps the hard Act that he had to sign. The “office of
                profit”, according to the English Act of Settlement in 1701 explains that no single individual who has a
                professional set up under the royal family, who has some kind of provision with or who is taking a
                pension from the prince has the right to work for the of the “House of Commons”. This will allow the
                royal family to have zero influence on the administrative conditions.</p>

                delivering a speech for the youth in an event at IIM Shillong. During the middle of the speech, he
                suffered from a cardiac arrest and collapsed. Although he got admitted to the best hospital in Shillong,
                the doctors could not save him.<br>Then his body was airlifted to Gugati, and from there, it was taken
                to New Delhi in an Airforce plane. Their President, vice president, and some other leaders prayed for
                his soul. His body was then covered in the Indian National flag and brought to his hometown. About 35000
                people attended his funeral event and prayed for such a great soul.
